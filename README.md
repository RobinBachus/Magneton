# Magneton - Gotcha

Welcome to Gotcha, a Pokémon-themed web application developed by Team Magneton. This project is a part of our school assignment and is named after the three-headed Pokémon, Magneton.

Gotcha is a web application that allows users to catch Pokémon, battle other Pokémon, and test their Pokémon knowledge. The application is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Features

Gotcha offers a variety of features for Pokémon enthusiasts:

-   **User Accounts**: Sign up and log in to manage your Pokemon.
-   **Catch Pokémon**: Explore and catch a variety of Pokémon.
-   **Pokémon Battles**: Battle other Pokémon using your caught Pokémon.
-   **Buddy Pokémon**: Choose one of your Pokémon as your buddy.
-   **Who's That Pokémon**: Test your Pokémon knowledge with our quiz.

## Navigation

Upon landing on the homepage, you'll find many games. However, only the Pokémon game is currently functional. Other games will lead to a 404 page.

## Technologies

Gotcha is built using the following technologies:

-   **Ejs**: A simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.

-   **Node.js**: An open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

-   **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

-   **MongoDB**: A general-purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era.
